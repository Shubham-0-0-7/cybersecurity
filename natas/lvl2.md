## Natas 2

so in this level you will see there is nothing in the html, css and js when you inspect the element ... so we got the hint from there, that there a folder named files by looking at the line <img src="files/pixel.png>  

![alt text](image.png)  

so now we will navigate to the files by adding /files in the end  
there you will see users.txt  
in that you will find password for natas 3
