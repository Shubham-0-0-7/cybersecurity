## Bandit Level 14 â†’ 15

### Login : ssh bandit14@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
### password : MU4VWeTyJk8ROof1qqmcBPaLh7lDCPvS

## Task

Send the current password to a service listening on port 30000 on localhost. The service will respond with the password for the next level.

### Quick theory

The current password for your level is stored in `/etc/bandit_pass/bandit14.`
nc (netcat) can open a TCP connection and send data: `echo "<password>" | nc localhost 30000`
The service expects the correct current password on stdin and prints the next-level password when correct.

### Solution
Read the current password and send it to the service:

```bash
bandit14@bandit:~$ cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14
MU4VWeTyJk8ROof1qqmcBPaLh7lDCPvS

bandit14@bandit:~$ echo "MU4VWeTyJk8ROof1qqmcBPaLh7lDCPvS" | nc localhost 30000
Correct!

(If you get Wrong! Please enter the correct current password., double-check you sent the exact contents of /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 including case and with no extra whitespace.)
