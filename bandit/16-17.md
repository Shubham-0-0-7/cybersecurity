## Bandit 16 to 17

login : ssh bandit16@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
password : kSkvUpMQ7lBYyCM4GBPvCvT1BfWRy0Dx

### Task 
The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to a port on localhost in the range 31000 to 32000. First find out which of these ports have a server listening on them. Then find out which of those speak SSL and which don’t. There is only 1 server that will give the next credentials, the others will simply send back to you whatever you send to it.

### Quick theory 

Bandit16 runs a set of TCP servers on localhost:31000–32000.  
Most servers simply echo back what you send.  
A few require SSL/TLS (openssl s_client can be used).  
The correct server will return a private key when you send the current password.  

Tools you’ll use:  
`nmap` → find open ports and detect services.  
`nc` (netcat) → interact with non-SSL servers.  
`openssl s_client` → interact with SSL servers.  

### Solution

```bash
bandit16@bandit:~$ nmap -sV localhost -p 31000-32000

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 142.61 seconds
```

So, nmap tells us that five ports are open. Only two ports (31518 and 31790) use SSL. Nmap also tells us that port 31518 runs only the echo service. The promising port seems to be port 31790, which runs an unknown service.  
Now we use OpenSSL again to connect to this port on localhost and send the password.   

```bash
bandit16@bandit:~$ openssl s_client -connect localhost:31790 -quiet

Welcome to OverTheWire!

If you find any problems, please report them to the #wargames channel on
discord or IRC.

--[ Playing the games ]--

  This machine might hold several wargames.
  If you are playing "somegame", then:

    * USERNAMES are somegame0, somegame1, ...
    * Most LEVELS are stored in /somegame/.
    * PASSWORDS for each level are stored in /etc/somegame_pass/.

  Write-access to homedirectories is disabled. It is advised to create a
  working directory with a hard-to-guess name in /tmp/.  You can use the
  command "mktemp -d" in order to generate a random and hard to guess
  directory in /tmp/.  Read-access to both /tmp/ is disabled and to /proc
  restricted so that users cannot snoop on eachother. Files and directories
  with easily guessable or short names will be periodically deleted! The /tmp
  directory is regularly wiped.
  Please play nice:

    * don't leave orphan processes running
    * don't leave exploit-files laying around
    * don't annoy other players
    * don't post passwords or spoilers
    * again, DONT POST SPOILERS!
      This includes writeups of your solution on your blog or website!

--[ Tips ]--

  This machine has a 64bit processor and many security-features enabled
  by default, although ASLR has been switched off.  The following
  compiler flags might be interesting:

    -m32                    compile for 32bit
    -fno-stack-protector    disable ProPolice
    -Wl,-z,norelro          disable relro

  In addition, the execstack tool can be used to flag the stack as
  executable on ELF binaries.

  Finally, network-access is limited for most levels by a local
  firewall.

--[ Tools ]--

 For your convenience we have installed a few useful tools which you can find
 in the following locations:

    * gef (https://github.com/hugsy/gef) in /opt/gef/
    * pwndbg (https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg) in /opt/pwndbg/
    * gdbinit (https://github.com/gdbinit/Gdbinit) in /opt/gdbinit/
    * pwntools (https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools)
    * radare2 (http://www.radare.org/)
