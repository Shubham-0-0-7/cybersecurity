### task
Get the password from a file, next to the word millionth

### theory lil bit
1. `grep <pattern>` prints lines that match <pattern>.
2. Use the pipe `|` to send output from one command into another (e.g. cat data.txt | grep millionth), though grep can read files directly: `grep millionth data.txt`.
3. For very large files, `grep` is much faster than manually inspecting with less or cat.

### solution

```bash
bandit7@bandit:~$ ls
data.txt
bandit7@bandit:~$ du -b data.txt
4184396	data.txt
bandit7@bandit:~$ cat data.txt | grep millionth
millionth	dfwvzFQi4mU0wfNbFOe9RoWskMLg7eEc
bandit7@bandit:~$
```
